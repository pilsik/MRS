Global Library Installation
Some javascript libraries need to be added to the global scope, and loaded as if they were in a script tag. We can do this using the apps[0].scripts and apps[0].styles properties of .angular-cli.json.

As an example, to use Bootstrap 4 this is what you need to do:

First install Bootstrap from npm:

npm install jquery --save
npm install popper.js --save
npm install bootstrap@next --save
Then add the needed script files to apps[0].scripts:

"scripts": [
  "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.js",
  "../node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.js",
  "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"
],
Finally add the Bootstrap CSS to the apps[0].styles array:

"styles": [
  "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css",
  "styles.css"
],
Restart ng serve if you're running it, and Bootstrap 4 should be working on your app.
